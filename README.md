# YahtzeeProject
CSE 321 Project - Group members: Mason Grant, Eric Khmelnitsky, and Daniel Townsend

This is a group project to develop a Yahtzee game using Java with a basic GUI. 
We will be testing the finished code using Input Space Partitioning, Graph Coverage, and Logic Coverage techniques, and creating a comprehensive testing plan. 
After completion, each team member will write a one-page document discussing their takeaways, 
and the team will give a 10-minute presentation showcasing the final product and the testing techniques used.
